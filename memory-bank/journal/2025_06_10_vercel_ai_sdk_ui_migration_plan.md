# Vercel AI SDK UI Migration Plan

**Date**: 2025-06-10  
**Author**: LegalEases Development Team  
**Status**: Planning Complete, Implementation Starting

## Overview

After successfully implementing the Vercel AI SDK for backend streaming generation, we've refined our plan for migrating the UI components to fully leverage Vercel AI SDK's streaming capabilities, ensuring optimal performance and user experience with Slovak legal content.

## Refined Technical Approach

### 1. Streaming-First Architecture

We've refined our approach to use Vercel AI SDK's advanced streaming primitives:

- Replace traditional UI interactions with streaming-optimized components
- Leverage `createStreamableUI` for progressive component rendering
- Use `StreamingTextResponse` with structured streaming for complex UI updates
- Implement dynamic UI updates during response generation

### 2. Advanced UI Components

Our refined implementation will use:

- `ChatbotMessages` with custom styling for consistent look and feel
- `ChatbotMessageContent` for automatic streaming animations
- Specialized components for sources, follow-up questions, and citations
- Typing indicators during streaming for improved user feedback
- Custom UI component extensions to maintain our current styling while adding streaming capabilities

### 3. Structured Response Handling

Enhanced approach for structured data:

```typescript
// Example of enhanced structured response handling
const { stream, writer } = createStreamableUI();

streamStructuredResponse(lastMessage, documentId, {
  onText: (text) => {
    writer.write({ type: 'text', value: text });
  },
  onSources: (sources) => {
    writer.write({
      type: 'sources',
      value: sources
    });
  },
  onFollowupQuestions: (questions) => {
    writer.write({
      type: 'followupQuestions',
      value: questions.map(q => ({
        label: q,
        onClick: () => {
          // Handle question click
        }
      }))
    });
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    writer.close();
  }
});
```

### 4. Supabase Integration

Enhanced database integration:

- Custom `ChatStorageAdapter` for seamless Supabase integration
- Structured message persistence with source attribution
- Type-safe message transformation between Vercel AI SDK and our database schema

### 5. Slovak Language Support

Ensure complete multilingual support:

- Wrap all Vercel AI SDK components with our translation context
- Maintain Slovak language prompts and responses
- Ensure proper translation of UI elements, placeholders and error messages

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Components** (Week 1)
   - Set up Vercel AI SDK UI dependencies
   - Create streaming API endpoint with structured response handling
   - Implement basic UI components with streaming capabilities

2. **Phase 2: Advanced UI** (Week 2)
   - Implement custom message components with sources and follow-up questions
   - Add real-time streaming indicators and progress feedback
   - Integrate Slovak language support throughout components

3. **Phase 3: Database Integration** (Week 3)
   - Create Supabase adapter for chat persistence
   - Implement document context handling
   - Ensure proper transformation of structured data

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization** (Week 4)
   - Test with real Slovak legal queries
   - Optimize streaming performance
   - Refine error handling with proper fallbacks

## Technical Considerations

- **Stream Processing**: Enhanced JSON parsing during streaming requires careful handling of partial messages
- **UI Rendering**: Need to handle various streaming states without UI jumps or flickering
- **Performance**: Optimize for low-latency streaming even with complex structured responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling during streaming with proper Slovak language error messages
- **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation during dynamic updates

## Benefits Over Original Plan

1. **Better Streaming UX**: Progressive rendering of complex responses provides immediate feedback
2. **Specialized UI Components**: Better leveraging of Vercel AI SDK's built-in streaming UI
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time UI updates during streaming without waiting for complete responses
4. **Structured Data Handling**: Better support for complex structured data with sources and follow-ups
5. **Performance**: Optimized streaming pipeline with minimal latency

## Next Steps

- Begin implementation with core components
- Set up streaming API endpoint
- Create prototypes of custom streaming UI components
- Test performance with various response structures and lengths
