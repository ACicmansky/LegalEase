# RAG to AI Agents Pivot

## Date: March 11, 2025

## Decision Summary

We've decided to pivot from the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach to an AI Agents architecture for our legal document assistant. This decision was made after encountering several challenges with the RAG implementation:

1. **Technical Complexity**: The RAG approach required complex vector stores, embedding generation, and retrieval mechanisms that led to several integration issues.
2. **Reliability Concerns**: Issues with localStorage in server environments, ambiguous SQL column references, and context passing between pipeline steps created stability problems.
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: The current implementation had many moving parts that would be difficult to maintain and extend.

## New Approach: AI Agents

The new AI Agents approach will focus on:

1. **Simplicity**: Direct document analysis without the overhead of vector embeddings and retrieval.
2. **Focused MVP**: User uploads a document → document is analyzed → key information extracted → consistency checked → simplified summary provided → user can ask follow-up questions.
3. **Specialized Agents**:
   - Document Processing Agent: For analyzing legal documents and extracting key insights
   - Conversational Agent: For handling follow-up questions and providing guidance

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Document Processing Agent
   - Create document analysis capabilities
   - Extract key information and laws
   - Check for inconsistencies
   - Generate simplified summaries

2. **Phase 2**: Conversational Agent
   - Enable follow-up questions about documents
   - Provide guidance on next steps
   - Handle legal queries in context of the document

3. **Phase 3**: Enhance and Extend
   - Improve agent capabilities
   - Add more specialized legal features
   - Optimize performance and accuracy

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer integration points and dependencies
2. **Faster Implementation**: More straightforward path to MVP
3. **Better User Experience**: Focused on delivering clear value
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Cleaner architecture and fewer moving parts
5. **Greater Flexibility**: Easier to extend with new capabilities

## Technical Implementation Details

- Keep existing document upload and storage functionality
- Develop document processing agent using the OpenAI API
- Create conversational agent capabilities
- Update API endpoints to reflect the new architecture
- Maintain the same database structure with minimal changes

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing the Document Processing Agent
2. Create the API endpoints for document analysis
3. Update the frontend to display document analysis results
4. Implement the Conversational Agent
5. Test the full flow with sample legal documents
