# Initial Setup - February 28, 2025

## Project Overview

Today marks the initialization of the memory bank for the AI-Powered Legal Assistant ("LegalEases") project. The application is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to help users understand legal documents and get answers to legal questions in the context of Slovak law.

## Key Components Identified

From reviewing the documentation, I've identified the following key components of the system:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - Document upload and storage
   - Text extraction and chunking
   - Vector embedding generation

2. **Chat System**
   - Context-aware chat interface
   - Integration with LangChain
   - Document-based conversation

3. **Database Structure**
   - Chats and Messages tables
   - Documents and Embeddings tables
   - Folders for organization

4. **Frontend Architecture**
   - Next.js with React
   - Tailwind CSS and ShadCN/UI
   - Responsive design for all devices

## Current State

The project appears to be in the implementation phase of the RAG system. The core files I've examined include:
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `src/lib/generation.ts`
- `src/lib/hybrid-search.ts`
- `src/lib/pipeline.ts`

These files are likely responsible for the chat API, text generation, search functionality, and document processing pipeline respectively.

## Next Steps

1. Examine the current implementation of these core files
2. Understand the document processing and embedding generation
3. Review the chat implementation and context retrieval
4. Identify any gaps or areas for improvement
5. Assist with optimizing the RAG implementation

## Questions to Explore

- How is the document chunking currently implemented?
- What embedding model is being used?
- How is context retrieval currently working?
- Is hybrid search (keyword + semantic) fully implemented?
- What is the current state of the chat interface?
