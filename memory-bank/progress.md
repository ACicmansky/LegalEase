## Known Issues

1. **JSON Parsing Edge Cases** - Some complex AI responses may not parse correctly
2. **Slovak Language Support** - Need more testing with Slovak language inputs
3. **Error Recovery** - Needs more robust error handling in some edge cases

## Project Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: ~75%
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enabled
- **Supabase Tables**: 6 (users, documents, document_analyses, chats, messages, folders)
- **Next.js App Router Integration**: Complete

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully implemented conversational agent with document-aware capabilities
- Implemented proper server-side execution for the agent
- Enhanced JSON parsing and error handling for AI responses
- Improved message types to support the conversational agent needs
- Refined Slovak language prompts for better localization
