# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is pivoting from the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach to an AI Agents architecture. This decision was made to reduce complexity and create a more reliable system. The new approach will:

1. Simplify the technical implementation
2. Provide a more focused user experience
3. Reduce dependency on complex vector stores and embedding integrations
4. Allow for easier maintenance and future enhancements

## Key Components Under Development

### 1. Document Processing Agent
- Document upload and storage (maintaining existing functionality)
- Text extraction and analysis
- Key information and law extraction 
- Consistency checking
- Document summary generation
- Proper database structure for document analyses

### 2. Conversational Agent
- Context-aware chat interface
- Follow-up questions about documents
- Guidance on legal next steps
- Document-based conversation capabilities

### 3. API Routes
- Document analysis endpoint 
- Message creation with user/assistant designation
- Document management API (maintaining existing functionality)
- Authentication and user management (maintaining existing functionality)

## Current Challenges

- Optimizing agent performance for large documents
- Ensuring secure and reliable document processing
- Implementing robust error handling for edge cases
- Integration testing across the complete pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration Testing**:
   - Test document processing pipeline end-to-end
   - Verify database structure alignment
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout

2. **Enhance Document Processing**:
   - Add pagination for large documents
   - Improve processing performance
   - Create admin tools for monitoring processing status

3. **Implement Conversational Agent**:
   - Design agent for follow-up questions
   - Enable document context awareness
   - Create guidance for next legal steps
   
4. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add typing indicators
   - Implement loading states
   - Create message queuing system

## Recent Decisions

- Refactored DocumentProcessingAgent to use a functional approach
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces for the database schema
- Fixed JSON parsing from AI model responses
- Streamlined UI components and user flow
- Updated document analysis API to use the new function-based approach
