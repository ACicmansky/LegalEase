# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project continues to improve the AI Agents architecture with a focus on type safety, performance, and maintainability. Recent work focuses on:

1. Consolidating message types across the application
2. Enhancing the conversational agent implementation 
3. Optimizing data transfer between frontend and backend


## Key Components Under Development

### 1. Document Processing Agent
- Document upload and storage (maintaining existing functionality)
- Text extraction and analysis
- Key information and law extraction 
- Consistency checking
- Document summary generation
- Proper database structure for document analyses

### 2. Conversational Agent
- Context-aware chat interface
- Follow-up questions about documents
- Guidance on legal next steps
- Document-based conversation capabilities
- Implementation with functional approach aligned with existing architecture
- Slovak language prompts for better localization
- Database access through dedicated tools instead of direct queries
- Enhanced JSON response parsing
- Added server-side directive for proper server component execution
- Fixed conversation prompt template invocation with required placeholders

### 3. Consolidated Type System
- Tiered message type hierarchy
  - BaseMessage: Core fields for all messages
  - ChatMessage: Extended for frontend display with user attribution
  - MessageRecord: Extended for backend/agent processing with metadata
- Enhanced MessageSource type with optional fields
- Integration across components, API routes, and agent processing
- Alignment with database schema

### 4. API Routes
- Updated messaging endpoints
- Proper typing with MessageRecord
- Enhanced error handling
- Clearer separation of roles for each endpoint
- Optimization of data transfer

## Current Challenges

- Optimizing agent performance for large documents
- Ensuring secure and reliable document processing
- Implementing robust error handling for edge cases
- Integration testing across the complete pipeline

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Integration Testing**:
   - Test document processing pipeline end-to-end
   - Verify database structure alignment
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout

2. **Enhance Document Processing**:
   - Add pagination for large documents
   - Improve processing performance
   - Create admin tools for monitoring processing status

3. **Implement Conversational Agent**:
   - Design agent for follow-up questions
   - Enable document context awareness
   - Create guidance for next legal steps
   
4. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add typing indicators
   - Implement loading states
   - Create message queuing system

## Recent Decisions

- Refactored DocumentProcessingAgent to use a functional approach
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces for the database schema
- Fixed JSON parsing from AI model responses
- Streamlined UI components and user flow
- Updated document analysis API to use the new function-based approach

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Test the conversational agent with the new message type system
2. Update API documentation to reflect the new type system
3. Monitor performance improvements from the type consolidation
