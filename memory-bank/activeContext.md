# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The project is currently in the implementation phase of the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system, which is a core component of the AI-powered legal assistant. This system enables the application to:

1. Process and understand legal documents uploaded by users
2. Retrieve relevant context from these documents when answering user queries
3. Generate accurate, context-aware responses based on the document content

## Key Components Under Development

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Document upload and storage using Supabase
- Text extraction and chunking for efficient processing
- Vector embedding generation for semantic search

### 2. Chat System
- Context-aware chat interface
- Integration with LangChain for AI orchestration
- Document-based conversation history

### 3. API Routes
- Chat API for handling user queries
- Document management API for upload and retrieval
- Authentication and user management

## Current Challenges

- Optimizing chunk size for effective retrieval
- Balancing response quality with performance
- Ensuring accurate context retrieval for legal documents
- Handling different document formats and structures
- **Integrating separate chat backends**: There are currently two parallel chat implementations that need to be merged:
  - `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`: Implements the RAG pipeline for AI responses
  - `src/app/api/chats/*`: Manages chat persistence and history in Supabase

## Next Steps

1. **Merge chat API implementations**:
   - Integrate the RAG pipeline from `chat/route.ts` into the chat message handling in `chats/[chatId]/messages/route.ts`
   - Ensure AI-generated responses are properly stored in the database
   - Connect document context from chat history to the RAG pipeline
2. Complete the RAG implementation with LangChain
3. Implement and test the chat interface
4. Optimize document processing for legal documents
5. Add support for document organization (folders)
6. Implement basic document generation capabilities

## Recent Decisions

- Using Supabase Vector Store for embeddings storage
- Implementing hybrid search (keyword + semantic) for better results
- Following Next.js App Router architecture
- Using TypeScript for type safety across the application
